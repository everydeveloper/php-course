# Essentials
## Requirements

PHP is a server-side language, so in order to make your code work you must put it on either a web-server or a local server.  Web servers can run as low as $5/month at godaddy.com or lunarpages.com.  For the purposes of this tutorial we will install a local server called WAMP

### Install the Server

 - Go to [http://www.wampserver.com/en/](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) and click  "START USING WAMPSERVER"
 - Choose either the 64bit or 32bit version.  (Most machines should run the 64 just fine but if in doubt choose 32)
 - Once WAMP is installed open a browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) if it works then your install is finished
 - Make sure to note where your php files are located in WAMP ie: C:\\wamp64\www (move or delete all files in this folder now)
 

### Install the Editor

 - To install notepad++ go to [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
 - Open notepad++ and select "Language" in the menu and choose PHP
 - As long as you are editing the file in the www folder, there is no need to "PUSH" anything.  If not you will need to move the file to the correct location on your computer or FTP client

When you have successfully installed a server and Text Editor, close this issue for the next step.
